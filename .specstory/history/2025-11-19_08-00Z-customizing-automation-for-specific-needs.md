**Identifying the Target Text**

I've opened the `src/pages/about.astro` file and am now scanning its contents. My goal is to pinpoint the exact location of "Automation tailored to Your Needs." Once I have it, I'll figure out the best way to apply the centering style to that specific text element.


**Locating the Phrase**

I'm systematically going through the `about.astro` file, looking for the phrase. So far, the file's structure seems straightforward, so I anticipate a quick search and find. I'm focusing on the HTML structure to understand how to best apply the centering.

**Examining Phrase Origins**

I'm currently investigating the origins of the phrase "Automation tailored to Your Needs." My initial search for the exact match yielded nothing. It seems there may be some variations at play. I'm considering case sensitivity, potential dynamic construction, or minor textual differences as contributing factors.


**Exploring Alternatives**

I broadened my search, making it case-insensitive to account for potential variations. Still, no exact matches. Given the focus on `about.astro`, I'm now contemplating whether the phrase is generated elsewhere or present in a related context. Perhaps a partial match is more fruitful.

**Analyzing Possible Sources**

I'm currently focused on the source code, specifically `src/pages/about.astro`. My goal is to pinpoint potential matches to the user's phrasing, recognizing they might be paraphrasing. I'm actively searching the file for likely sections or headings that could be the source of their input.


**Searching for Context Clues**

I've examined the `src/pages/about.astro` file again, zeroing in on general terms like "Automation" to see if there's a broader section related to the user's phrasing. Nothing definitive yet, so I'll broaden my search.

**Inspecting Page Content**

I've just examined the `src/pages/about.astro` file. The target phrase, "Automation tailored to Your Needs," isn't present. My next step is to check `index.astro`, `platforms.astro`, and `demo.astro` to see if it resides there. The possibility of dynamic content also exists, which requires further investigation.


**Analyzing Other Files**

I've scanned `src/pages/index.astro`, `src/pages/platforms.astro`, and `src/pages/demo.astro`. The phrase remains elusive! Considering the size of the project, I will now perform a global search of the entire codebase for "Automation tailored". This should pinpoint the exact location.

**Considering Relevant Code Snippet**

I've located a key code snippet within `src/pages/kiosks.astro`. Specifically, I've noted a heading that highlights automation services, and now I'm mulling over its implications within the broader context of the project.


**Evaluating Page Context**

I've pinpointed the relevant section in `src/pages/kiosks.astro` containing the automation heading. There is a discrepancy between the open file and the search results, so I am digging deeper. Now I'm examining the surrounding code to determine how styles and parent containers might affect the text alignment, considering the `text-center` class.
