**Contemplating Contact Page FAQs**

I'm focused on removing particular FAQs from the contact page. Currently, I'm zeroing in on removing the "Do you support PAN India deployments?" question and answer. My goal is to ensure the displayed information is accurate and efficient.


**Evaluating FAQ Removal Strategy**

I'm now formulating my plan. First, I'll read the `src/pages/contact.astro` file. Then, I'll search for the specified FAQ content and its surrounding HTML or code blocks. Finally, I'll excise the identified blocks. I believe I can accomplish this with precision, targeting only the necessary removals to streamline the page's information.

**Removing Unwanted Sections**

I've successfully identified the FAQs to be removed, specifically those concerning PAN India deployments and support offerings, as indicated by their line numbers. My next step involves isolating these sections within the file for deletion. I'm focusing on preserving the integrity of the document structure during this editing process.


**Initiating File Modification**

I've pinpointed the exact lines containing the FAQs slated for removal. Now, I'm preparing to use `search_replace` to excise the targeted HTML blocks from the file. I am verifying the efficacy of my search parameters to ensure precise deletion, avoiding accidental removal of any unrelated content within the document.

**Confirming Content Integrity**

I've just finished removing the specified FAQs. Now, I'm meticulously checking the file. Making sure the formatting is impeccable is critical, so I'm on the lookout for any rogue empty lines or formatting quirks that could lead to display issues. I want to make sure the remaining content is perfect.


**Re-evaluating Formatting Now**

I've carefully reviewed the remaining FAQs and the surrounding format. Now, I'm specifically scrutinizing the FAQ section. I'm focusing on "How fast can I get a demo?" and "Can you customize solutions?". I want to verify they are structured and displayed correctly within the document's design.

Also add FAQs by scraping the website. Only factual FAQs. No BS.

**Initiating Data Acquisition**

I'm hitting a snag. I can't directly access the live website or a local instance to scrape for FAQs, so I'm rethinking my approach. Currently, I'm focusing on alternative strategies for gathering relevant question-and-answer pairs, possibly using example FAQs or prompt engineering. This looks to be the only path forward.


**Reframing the Strategy**

I've shifted gears. Instead of web scraping, I'm now analyzing the Astro project files directly. I'm focusing on identifying key product pages and other relevant content within the codebase. My plan is to extract factual information about Frog8's products and services, like the "What is Frog8?" question, and key features.


**Mapping Internal Resources**

My immediate task is to generate a comprehensive list of pages within the `src/pages` directory. This will allow me to pinpoint specific product pages and identify the core factual content available. I anticipate this will streamline the process of extracting relevant information for FAQ generation, ensuring that the questions and answers are grounded in the project's own documentation and content.

**Inspecting the Pages**

I'm currently reviewing the product pages, including `transigo.astro`, `navigo.astro`, and `veriphy.astro`, to grasp the product line's structure. I'll also check `cts.astro`, `kiosks.astro`, `deployments.astro` and consider `index.astro` for context.


**Formulating Questions Based**

I've moved on to drafting some FAQs now. I'm focusing on defining the products – Transigo, Navigo, and Veriphy – and identifying the target industries. Security is another key area I'll explore, keeping an eye out for relevant certifications. I've started gathering initial details from `index.astro`, `about.astro`, and `transigo.astro`.

**Comprehending the Data**

I've successfully identified the factual basis for constructing some FAQs. Specifically, I have analyzed details pertaining to the TransiGo platform, including its deployment location, supported features like QR ticketing, and payment methods. This provides a solid foundation.


**Formulating Questions Now**

I'm now formulating the first FAQ drafts, leveraging the facts I've extracted. I'm focusing on the deployment location, supported payment options, and the general features of the TransiGo platform. I'm also preparing to integrate information about the "TransiGo 4000" kiosk into the FAQ set.


**Refining FAQ Content**

I'm presently refining the FAQs, focusing on conciseness and clarity. The current set covers deployment location, payment methods, instant card issuance, and broader solutions. I'm also ensuring the answers are easily digestible for the target audience.


**Implementing the Drafts**

I'm integrating the FAQs I drafted, based on the fact extraction, into the `contact.astro` file. I'm ensuring they're correctly formatted within the existing structure and maintaining the clarity and concise style. I'm also confirming the factual accuracy to prevent misleading answers.

**Drafting FAQ Revisions**

\n\n

I'm focused on the FAQ updates. I've noted the user's need for factual, clear responses and am working to align. Currently, I've got two FAQs drafted, and plan to add three more based on my factual review of the data. I've got a start on "Where are your..." which needs fleshing out with the relevant details.


**Planning FAQ Additions**

\n\n

Okay, I'm pivoting to building out the new FAQs. Based on the user's feedback, I'm sticking strictly to factual answers. I've got the five new questions ready: where kiosks are deployed, payment methods, instant card issuance, solutions beyond transit, and security compliance. Now I'm working to write the most direct responses possible. I'll drop them right into that specific div class.
