**Defining the Problem Space**

I'm currently grappling with a rather nebulous request, "fix hyphen across the website." My initial focus is pinpointing the exact scope. It seems the user's concern likely centers on both automated hyphenation (CSS and its settings) and inconsistent hyphen usage within the content. Clarifying this distinction is the immediate priority.


**Investigating Code and Context**

I've moved on to examining the codebase. My goal is to understand how hyphenation is currently implemented. I'm focusing on CSS files, particularly those that handle global styling, like `global.css`. I'm using search terms such as "hyphen" and "hyphens" to identify relevant code. The aim is to quickly pinpoint the scope of any existing settings and understand if automatic hyphenation is enabled globally or selectively.

**Inspecting Hyphenation Logic**

I've explored the codebase, specifically targeting `src/layouts/Layout.astro`, expecting to find the CSS controls for hyphenation. The search for "hyphens" yielded no direct matches, suggesting the setting isn't explicitly defined. I'll proceed with further investigation to understand how text hyphenation is handled.


**Scouting Style Definitions**

I'm now revisiting `src/layouts/Layout.astro` and digging into the `src/styles` directory again, focusing on `kiosk.css`. My hunch is growing that the global styles, if present, are likely where the hyphenation control resides. Further investigation is needed to confirm whether it uses `hyphens: none` or if there's an alternative method implemented to control the rendering.

**Analyzing Hyphenation Behavior**

I've been examining `src/layouts/Layout.astro` and the absence of a `hyphens` property. My initial observation is confirmed: no `hyphens` rule exists. Consequently, the default browser behavior of `manual` hyphenation is in effect, dependent on the presence of soft hyphens. This is a crucial detail to consider.


**Evaluating Potential Fixes**

I'm now investigating possible solutions, pivoting from the absence of a `hyphens` property to the specifics of the problem. Considering the examples provided, I'm leaning towards `hyphens: none;` as a potential fix for unwanted automatic hyphenation. I'll search the codebase for instances of "Frog-8" and "Frog 8" (case-insensitive) and the absence of a `hyphens` property in CSS files.

**Examining Word Breaks**

I've determined that "Frog-8" isn't present, and neither are any hyphens. It appears the user's concern centers around how words are broken visually. The default behavior is manual hyphenation if hyphens aren't specifically set. My code shows "lang=en" is active within the layout.


**Confirming Hyphenation Strategy**

I'm proceeding with the global hyphenation fix. I've added `hyphens: none;` along with the vendor prefixes `-webkit-hyphens: none;` and `-ms-hyphens: none;` to the `html` selector in `src/layouts/Layout.astro` for broad compatibility. My current focus is to ensure the fix is correctly implemented and doesn't introduce any unforeseen layout issues.


**Implementing Global Fixes**

My analysis is complete. The user likely wants to disable automatic hyphenation, and I'm adding `hyphens: none;` along with the vendor prefixes to the `html` selector in `src/layouts/Layout.astro`. I've confirmed this is the primary layout. I'm double-checking the insertion point now.

**Applying CSS Rules**

I've decided to incorporate `hyphens: none` within the `html` selector of the `Layout.astro` file. This change aims to refine the text rendering behavior across the board. The code has been written and is ready for the next stage of integration.


**Adding Specificity to CSS**

My focus has shifted. I've successfully written the CSS rules, incorporating `hyphens: none` to the `html` selector within the `Layout.astro` file. The code now includes vendor prefixes for broader browser compatibility. Integration is next on the list.

**Examining Hyphenation Control**

I've successfully disabled automatic hyphenation globally via CSS. Now, I'm meticulously searching the codebase to identify and address any manually inserted soft hyphens or related character entities that could be overriding the global setting and causing unintended hyphenation. It's a delicate hunt.


**Assessing Hyphenation's State**

My initial focus remains on ensuring no unwanted hyphens appear. I've confirmed `hyphens: none` is in place, and I'm further validating this by searching for any instances of soft hyphens or similar characters within the codebase. I also re-ran my "Frog-8" grep, finding no matches. I am now linting the modified files.

**Concluding the Lint Fixes**

I've finally cleaned up the lints. To address the inconsistent word breaks, I globally disabled hyphenation within the layout file. Next steps: create a to-do list to make sure this is all wrapped up neatly.


**Planning the Final Touches**

I've just finished the global fix for the word breaks by disabling hyphenation in the layout file. Now I'm shifting gears to create a simple to-do list for my post-lint review, just to ensure everything is buttoned up.

**Interpreting Ambiguity**

I'm now considering the ambiguity in the phrase "Fix hyphen across the website." Beyond the initial interpretation, I'm exploring other potential meanings, like correcting inconsistencies in hyphenated brand names, such as "Frog-8," which could be written as "Frog8."


**Confirming Alternatives**

I've just broadened the scope of my investigation. I'm now explicitly checking for case-insensitive matches of "Frog-8" and "Frog 8," along with related variations to address the ambiguity in the original prompt. So far, the searches, both case-sensitive and -insensitive have turned up no results, but it is important to be thorough.

Okay, so I've ruled out the straightforward "Frog-8" to "Frog8" correction. Now, I'm pivoting to consider something like "Fin-tech". I'm trying to figure out if there is a pattern in this.

**Fixing the Layout**

I've zeroed in on the CSS hyphenation problem. The fix is now implemented within `src/layouts/Layout.astro`. My next step is to communicate this solution to the user, confirming the applied adjustments.


</details></think>

---

I have updated the global CSS to disable automatic hyphenation across the website. This prevents words from breaking with hyphens at the end of lines, which ensures a cleaner and more professional look for the text.

**Changes Applied:**
- Modified `src/layouts/Layout.astro` to add `hyphens: none` (including vendor prefixes) to the global `html` selector.

```css
  html {
    /* ... existing styles ... */
    -webkit-hyphens: none;
    -moz-hyphens: none;
    -ms-hyphens: none;
    hyphens: none;
  }
```

This change propagates to all pages since they all use the main
