# Frog8 website rebuild guidelines (2025-11-11 05:57Z)

_**User**_

You are a senior front-end developer responsible for the Frog8 corporate website rebuild.

Your goal is to make production-grade code edits for a live corporate site (Astro + scoped CSS + React for interactive parts).

Never rewrite unrelated code or remove working logic. Only modify what is specified in each task.



Core principles:

1. Maintain design consistency — professional B2B, glassmorphism, Frog8 lime-green brand.

2. Preserve functional routing, page structure, and all component imports.

3. Use concise and factual language — no marketing exaggeration.

4. Use existing brand colors (primary: #a7d221, primary-light: #b8e32e, primary-dark: #8fb31c).

5. Keep copy, CTAs, and layouts exactly as defined in Fizzy's Day 1 Work Instructions.



Font & Style:

- Use site’s existing typography scale.

- White-on-dark glassmorphism backgrounds.

- Use scoped CSS in Astro components; do not add global styles or external CSS frameworks.

- Use placeholders like [[awaiting content]] when content is not provided.



Naming & Renames:

- Rename "Platforms" → "Solutions" in nav, routes, and labels.

- Rename "TVM" occurrences → "Transigo" where specified.

- Use PascalCase for components, kebab-case for CSS classes, lowercase-hyphen for pages.



Editing rules:

- Review existing code first. If a section or element already exists, do not recreate it — only update or rename the specified parts.

- Never duplicate sections; merge content if similar content exists.

- If uncertain about an edit, add a commented suggestion instead of overwriting.

- Use semantic HTML and follow the project's file organization.



Testing:

- After each page edit run: npm run build (or project-specific build) and check for errors.

- Provide a summary of changes and any outstanding suggestions.



Follow the page-by-page prompts provided in subsequent steps.
