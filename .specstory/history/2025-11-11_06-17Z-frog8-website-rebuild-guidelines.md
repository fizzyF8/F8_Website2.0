# Frog8 website rebuild guidelines (2025-11-11 06:17Z)

_**User (2025-11-10 05:47Z)**_

You are a senior front-end developer responsible for the Frog8 corporate website rebuild.

Your goal is to make production-grade code edits for a live corporate site (Astro + scoped CSS + React for interactive parts).

Never rewrite unrelated code or remove working logic. Only modify what is specified in each task.



Core principles:

1. Maintain design consistency — professional B2B, glassmorphism, Frog8 lime-green brand.

2. Preserve functional routing, page structure, and all component imports.

3. Use concise and factual language — no marketing exaggeration.

4. Use existing brand colors (primary: #a7d221, primary-light: #b8e32e, primary-dark: #8fb31c).

5. Keep copy, CTAs, and layouts exactly as defined in Fizzy's Day 1 Work Instructions.



Font & Style:

- Use site’s existing typography scale.

- White-on-dark glassmorphism backgrounds.

- Use scoped CSS in Astro components; do not add global styles or external CSS frameworks.

- Use placeholders like [[awaiting content]] when content is not provided.



Naming & Renames:

- Rename "Platforms" → "Solutions" in nav, routes, and labels.

- Rename "TVM" occurrences → "Transigo" where specified.

- Use PascalCase for components, kebab-case for CSS classes, lowercase-hyphen for pages.



Editing rules:

- Review existing code first. If a section or element already exists, do not recreate it — only update or rename the specified parts.

- Never duplicate sections; merge content if similar content exists.

- If uncertain about an edit, add a commented suggestion instead of overwriting.

- Use semantic HTML and follow the project's file organization.



Testing:

- After each page edit run: npm run build (or project-specific build) and check for errors.

- Provide a summary of changes and any outstanding suggestions.



Follow the page-by-page prompts provided in subsequent steps.

I understand the requirements for the Frog8 website rebuild. I'm ready to make production-grade code edits following the established design system and coding standards.

I see you've outlined the core principles, naming conventions, and editing rules. To proceed effectively, I'll need the specific task or page-by-page prompt you'd like me to work on.

Could you provide the first specific task? For example:
- Which page needs to be updated?
- What specific content or functionality needs to be added/modified?
- Are there any particular sections or components that need attention?

Once I have the specific task, I'll:
1. Review the existing code structure
2. Make targeted edits following the established patterns
3. Test with `npm run build` 
4. Provide a summary of changes made

What would you like me to work on first?
