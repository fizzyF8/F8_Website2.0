1. A professional company website (Frog8 - fintech/infrastructure)
2. Built with Astro + React
3. Has a modern glassmorphism design
4. Needs to maintain consistency in branding (green #a7d221 color scheme)
5. Has specific animation patterns
6. Mobile-first responsive design
7. Professional content focused on B2B clients

I should create comprehensive cursor rules that cover:

+ # Frog8 Website - Cursor Rules
+ 
+ ## Project Overview
+ This is the Frog8 company website - a professional B2B platform showcasing fintech and infrastructure solutions. The site emphasizes modern design with glassmorphism, smooth animations, and a distinctive lime-green brand identity.
+ 
+ ## Tech Stack
+ - **Framework**: Astro 5.14.1 (Static Site Generation)
+ - **UI Components**: React 19.1.0 (for interactive elements only)
+ - **3D Graphics**: Three.js 0.177.0
+ - **Styling**: CSS (scoped styles in Astro components)
+ - **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
+ 
+ ## Design System
+ 
+ ### Brand Colors (PRIMARY - NEVER CHANGE)
+ ```css
+ --primary: #a7d221        /* Frog8 lime green */
+ --primary-light: #b8e32e  /* Lighter variant */
+ --primary-dark: #8fb31c   /* Darker variant */
+ --background: #ffffff
+ --background-light: #f8f9fa
+ --text: #1a1a1a
+ --text-muted: #6b7280
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Typography
+ - **Primary Font**: Inter (Google Fonts) - professional, modern
+ - **Headings**: Font weights 600-800, letter-spacing: -0.02em
+ - **Body**: Font weight 400-500, line-height: 1.6-1.7
+ - **Responsive**: Use clamp() for fluid typography
+ 
+ ### Spacing System
+ - Use 8px base unit (0.5rem increments)
+ - Container max-width: 1280px
+ - Section padding: 120px vertical (desktop), 60px (mobile)
+ 
+ ## Code Quality Standards
+ 
+ ### File Organization
+ ```
+ src/
+ ├── components/     # Reusable UI components
+ ├── layouts/        # Page layouts (Layout.astro)
+ ├── pages/          # Route pages (index.astro, about.astro, etc.)
+ ├── assets/         # Images, icons, logos
+ └── styles/         # Global styles (if needed)
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Naming Conventions
+ - **Files**: PascalCase for components (Navigation.astro, MobileMenu.jsx)
+ - **Pages**: lowercase with hyphens (about.astro, contact.astro)
+ - **CSS Classes**: kebab-case (nav-link, btn-primary, tvm-card)
+ - **Variables**: camelCase in JS, kebab-case in CSS
+ 
+ ### Component Guidelines
+ 
+ #### Astro Components (.astro)
+ ```astro
+ ---
+ // 1. Imports first
+ import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';
+ import Component from '../components/Component.astro';
+ 
+ // 2. Props interface (if needed)
+ export interface Props {
+   title?: string;
+ }
+ 
+ // 3. Props destructuring with defaults
+ const { title = "Default Title" } = Astro.props;
+ ---
+ 
+ <!-- 4. HTML structure -->
+ <Layout>
+   <!-- Semantic HTML5 elements -->
+   <section class="section">
+     <div class="container">
+       <!-- Content -->
+     </div>
+   </section>
+ </Layout>
+ 
+ <style>
+   /* 5. Scoped styles at bottom */
+   .section {
+     /* Component-specific styles */
+   }
+ </style>
+ ```
+ 
+ #### React Components (.jsx)
+ - Use ONLY for interactive features (menus, galleries, modals)
+ - Add `client:load` directive in Astro for hydration
+ - Export default function ComponentName()
+ - Use hooks (useState, useEffect) appropriately
+ - Include PropTypes or TypeScript types
+ 
+ ## Design Patterns
+ 
+ ### Glassmorphism (SIGNATURE STYLE)
+ ```css
+ .glass {
+   background: linear-gradient(135deg, 
+     rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9) 0%, 
+     rgba(248, 250, 252, 0.95) 100%
+   );
+   backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
+   border: 1px solid rgba(167, 210, 33, 0.1);
+   border-radius: 24px;
+   box-shadow: 
+     0 8px 32px rgba(167, 210, 33, 0.08),
+     0 4px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Animations (SMOOTH & PROFESSIONAL)
+ - Use `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` for transitions
+ - Hover effects: translateY(-8px) with shadow increase
+ - Page load: fade-in, slide-up animations
+ - Keep animations under 0.6s duration
+ - Add `will-change` for performance on heavy animations
+ 
+ ### Button Styles
+ ```css
+ .btn-primary {
+   background: linear-gradient(135deg, #a7d221 0%, #b8e32e 100%);
+   color: white;
+   padding: 14px 28px;
+   border-radius: 16px;
+   font-weight: 600;
+   transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
+ }
+ 
+ .btn-primary:hover {
+   transform: translateY(-2px);
+   box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(167, 210, 33, 0.3);
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Responsive Design (MOBILE-FIRST)
+ 
+ ### Breakpoints
+ ```css
+ /* Mobile: < 480px (base styles) */
+ @media (max-width: 480px) { }
+ 
+ /* Small tablets: 640px */
+ @media (max-width: 640px) { }
+ 
+ /* Tablets: 768px */
+ @media (max-width: 768px) { }
+ 
+ /* Large tablets: 900px */
+ @media (max-width: 900px) { }
+ 
+ /* Desktop: 1024px+ */
+ @media (min-width: 1024px) { }
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Mobile Optimization Rules
+ 1. Stack grid columns on mobile (grid-cols-1)
+ 2. Reduce padding: p-8 → p-4 on small screens
+ 3. Font sizes: Use clamp() or reduce by 20-30%
+ 4. Hide decorative elements on mobile (particles, background effects)
+ 5. Full-width buttons on mobile
+ 6. Increase touch target sizes (min 44px)
+ 
+ ## Content & Messaging
+ 
+ ### Tone of Voice
+ - **Professional**: B2B audience (banks, metros, enterprises)
+ - **Confident**: "Powering India Next" - authoritative
+ - **Clear & Concise**: No jargon unless industry-specific
+ - **Action-Oriented**: "Get Started", "Learn More", "Schedule Demo"
+ 
+ ### Copywriting Rules
+ 1. Headlines: Action-oriented, benefit-focused
+ 2. Descriptions: 1-2 sentences max, value-first
+ 3. CTAs: Clear next steps, contrasting buttons
+ 4. Technical specs: Bulleted lists, easy to scan
+ 5. Avoid: Marketing fluff, excessive adjectives, vague claims
+ 
+ ### SEO Best Practices
+ - Unique title/description per page
+ - Descriptive alt text for all images
+ - Semantic HTML5 (section, article, nav, header, footer)
+ - Heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
+ - Internal linking between related pages
+ 
+ ## Performance
+ 
+ ### Image Optimization
+ - Use Astro's Image component for optimization
+ - Add `loading="lazy"` for below-fold images
+ - Add `loading="eager"` for hero images
+ - WebP format preferred, PNG fallback
+ - Max width: 2000px for hero images
+ 
+ ### Code Splitting
+ - Keep React components minimal
+ - Use `client:load` only when necessary
+ - Consider `client:visible` for below-fold interactive elements
+ - Lazy load heavy components (3D models, galleries)
+ 
+ ## Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
+ 
+ ### Essential Requirements
+ 1. **Color Contrast**: 4.5:1 minimum for text
+ 2. **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
+ 3. **ARIA Labels**: Add to icon-only buttons, navigation
+ 4. **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus states on all interactive elements
+ 5. **Alt Text**: Descriptive for meaningful images, empty for decorative
+ 6. **Semantic HTML**: Use proper elements (button, nav, main, etc.)
+ 
+ ### Implementation
+ ```html
+ <!-- Good -->
+ <button aria-label="Open menu" class="menu-btn">
+   <svg aria-hidden="true">...</svg>
+ </button>
+ 
+ <!-- Bad -->
+ <div onclick="openMenu()">...</div>
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Component-Specific Rules
+ 
+ ### Navigation
+ - Fixed position, glassmorphism background
+ - Desktop: horizontal links with hover effects
+ - Mobile: Fullscreen overlay menu (React component)
+ - Sticky on scroll, blur backdrop
+ - Logo always links to homepage
+ 
+ ### Footer
+ - 4-column layout (Company, Products, Resources, Connect)
+ - Social icons with hover effects
+ - Copyright year dynamic: {new Date().getFullYear()}
+ - Links in dark text on light glass background
+ 
+ ### Hero Sections
+ - Full viewport height (min-height: 100vh)
+ - Animated background (particles, floating orbs, grid)
+ - Gradient text for brand keywords
+ - Clear CTA buttons below fold
+ - Text shadow for readability
+ 
+ ### Cards
+ - Use `.glass` or `.card-premium` classes
+ - Hover: lift with shadow increase
+ - Rounded corners (20-24px)
+ - Consistent padding (2rem desktop, 1rem mobile)
+ 
+ ## Git Workflow
+ 
+ ### Commit Messages
+ - Format: `type: description`
+ - Types: feat, fix, style, refactor, docs, perf, test
+ - Examples:
+   - `feat: add partner logos to deployments page`
+   - `fix: mobile menu not closing on link click`
+   - `style: update button hover animations`
+ 
+ ### Before Committing
+ 1. Test on mobile viewport (< 480px)
+ 2. Check all interactive elements
+ 3. Verify no console errors
+ 4. Run `npm run build` to check for build errors
+ 5. Validate links and images
+

+ <section class="section gradient-bg pt-32">
+   <div class="container">
+     <div class="text-center mb-16">
+       <h2 class="slide-up mb-6">
+         Heading <span class="text-green">Highlight</span>
+       </h2>
+       <p class="text-xl max-w-3xl mx-auto">
+         Description text
+       </p>
+     </div>
+     
+     <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
+       <!-- Grid items -->
+     </div>
+   </div>
+ </section>
+ 
+ <div class="section-divider"></div>
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Form Inputs
+ ```astro
+ <div>
+   <label for="name" class="f8-label">Full Name *</label>
+   <input
+     type="text"
+     id="name"
+     name="name"
+     required
+     class="f8-input"
+     placeholder="Your full name"
+   />
+ </div>
+ ```
+ 
+ ## What NOT to Do
+ 
+ ❌ **Never** change the primary brand color (#a7d221)
+ ❌ **Never** use inline styles (use scoped CSS or classes)
+ ❌ **Never** add external CSS frameworks (Tailwind, Bootstrap)
+ ❌ **Never** use jQuery or legacy libraries
+ ❌ **Never** create pages without proper SEO meta tags
+ ❌ **Never** use `!important` in CSS (refactor specificity instead)
+ ❌ **Never** add animations longer than 1 second
+ ❌ **Never** break mobile responsiveness
+ ❌ **Never** remove accessibility features
+ ❌ **Never** hardcode contact info (use centralized variables)
+ 
+ ## When Adding New Features
+ 
+ ### Process
+ 1. **Plan**: Sketch layout, consider mobile-first
+ 2. **Design**: Use brand colors, glassmorphism, smooth animations
+ 3. **Code**: Follow file structure, naming conventions
+ 4. **Test**: All breakpoints, interactions, accessibility
+ 5. **Optimize**: Images, code splitting, performance
+ 6. **Document**: Update README if significant change
+ 
+ ### Questions to Ask
+ - Does this fit the brand identity (professional, modern)?
+ - Is it responsive on all screen sizes?
+ - Does it maintain the glassmorphism aesthetic?
+ - Is the animation smooth and purposeful?
+ - Does it improve user experience?
+ - Is it accessible?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've created comprehensive cursor rules for the Frog8 website. Now let me explain what I've included and why these rules are specifically tailored for this project.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've created comprehensive **cursor rules** specifically tailored for your Frog8 website. Here's what I've included:

## **Key Sections in the Rules:**

### 1️⃣ **Design System Standards**
- 🎨 **Brand Colors** (protected - your signature #a7d221 green)
- 📝 **Typography** (Inter font, responsive sizing)
- 📏 **Spacing** (8px base unit system)

### 2️⃣ **Code Quality & Organization**
- 📁 File structure conventions
- 🏷️ Naming patterns (PascalCase, kebab-case, camelCase)
- 📦 Component templates for Astro & React

### 3️⃣ **Signature Design Patterns**
- ✨ **Glassmorphism** (your distinctive style)
- 🎭 **Smooth Animations** (cubic-bezier timing)
- 🎯 **Button Styles** (gradient hover effects)

### 4️⃣ **Responsive Design Rules**
- 📱 Mobile-first approach
- 📐 Specific breakpoints (480px, 640px, 768px, 900px, 1024px)
- ✅ Mobile optimization checklist

### 5️⃣ **Content & Messaging Guidelines**
- 💼 Professional B2B tone
- ✍️ Copywriting standards
- 🔍 SEO best practices

### 6️⃣ **Performance & Accessibility**
- ⚡ Image optimization rules
- ♿ WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- 🚀 Code splitting strategies

### 7️⃣ **Testing & Deployment**
- ✅ Pre-deployment checklist
- 🌐 Browser compatibility requirements
- 📋 Common patterns to follow

### 8️⃣ **Do's and Don'ts**
- ❌ **Never change** the primary brand color
- ❌ **Never break** mobile responsiveness
- ❌ **Never remove** accessibility features

## **Why These Rules Work for Your Project:**

✅ **Professional**: Ensures B2B credibility with enterprise clients  
✅ **Modern**: Maintains your glassmorphism and animation aesthetic  
✅ **Consistent**: Everyone follows the same design patterns  
✅ **Scalable**: Easy to add new pages/features that fit the brand  
✅ **Accessible**: Ensures WCAG compliance for all users  
✅ **Performant**: Optimizes load times and user experience  

## **How This Helps You:**

1. **AI assistance** will now understand your brand guidelines automatically
2. **New developers** can onboard quickly with clear standards
3. **Design consistency** is maintained across all updates
4. **Quality assurance** is built into the development process
5. **Brand protection** prevents accidental design drift

The rules are now active! Any AI assistant (including me) will automatically follow these guidelines when making changes to your website. This ensures your site stays professional, modern, and consistent with the Frog8 brand identity! 🚀

Want me to make any adjustments to these rules or shall we start implementing some improvements to the website?

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to identify and fix any issues related to theme, UI, styling, and UX across the website. Let me analyze what I've seen and identify potential improvements:

1. **Inconsistencies I noticed:**
   - Some pages have different hero section heights
   - Color inconsistencies in text (some use inline styles, some use classes)
   - Mobile menu icon colors might not match
   - Footer has inline styles instead of using class utilities
   - Some animations might not be consistent across pages
   - Contact page has different styling approach
   - Accessibility issues with contrast in some areas

2. **Theme/UI Issues:**
   - Navigation gradient might be too bright/dominant
   - Text color inconsistencies (black vs text-green vs white)
   - Some cards have different hover effects
   - Section dividers vary in style across pages
   - Button styles not always consistent

3. **UX Issues:**
   - Mobile menu hamburger icon could be more visible
   - Touch targets might be too small on mobile
   - Some forms don't have clear focus states
   - Inconsistent spacing between sections
   - Some hero sections too tall on mobile

4. **Styling Issues:**
   - Inline styles in Footer (should use classes)
   - Inconsistent use of glassmorphism
   - Some responsive breakpoints not working optimally
   - Text contrast issues in some areas

Let me create a comprehensive plan and start fixing these issues systematically.</details></think>

Excellent! I've successfully completed all the **theme, UI, styling, and UX improvements** across your Frog8 website! 🎉

## ✅ **Complete Summary of Improvements:**

### **1. Navigation System** ✨

- **Improved contrast** - Dark text on light background for better readability
- **Enhanced mobile menu** - Better visibility with styled hamburger button

- **Mobile responsive padding** - Optimized for smaller screens

### **2. Footer Redesign** 🎯
- **Removed all inline styles** - Now uses CSS classes
- **Clean glassmorphism effect** - Matches overall site aesthetic
- **Consistent color scheme** - Uses CSS variables (var(--primary), var(--text))
- **Improved link hover effects** - Slides to the right with color change
- **Social icons** - Scale up on hover with background highlight
- **Better structure** - Semantic classes like `.footer-link`, `.footer-heading`

### **3. Hero Sections Standardization** 🚀
- **Consistent heights** - 70vh desktop, 60vh tablet, 50vh mobile
- **Proper padding** - 8rem top, 4rem bottom (responsive)
- **Flex centering** - Content always centered vertically
- **Mobile optimizations** - Reduced heights for better UX

### **4. Button System Overhaul** 🎨
- **Enhanced primary buttons** - Better gradient with shadow effects
- **Secondary buttons** - Subtle border and hover lift
- **Focus states** - Visible outline for keyboard navigation (accessibility)
- **Active states** - Visual feedback on click
- **Hover animations** - Smooth translateY and shadow changes

### **5. Form Accessibility** ♿
- **Focus outlines** - 2px solid green outline with offset
- **Input styling** - Clean borders with hover/focus states
- **Box shadows on focus** - 3px glow effect for visibility
- **Consistent padding** - 0.875rem for comfortable interaction
- **Smooth transitions** - All states animate smoothly

### **6. Section Dividers** 📏
- **Standardized height** - 2px (1.5px tablet, 1px mobile)
- **Consistent opacity** - 0.3 (0.25 on mobile)
- **Auto margins** - Always centered with max-width 1280px
- **Responsive spacing** - 80px/60px/40px margins

### **7. Text Color Consistency** 🎨
- **About page fixed** - Removed `text-white/90` inconsistencies
- **CSS variables used** - `var(--text)`, `var(--text-muted)`, `var(--primary)`
- **Glass components** - Light background with dark text
- **Better contrast ratios** - WCAG compliant

### **8. Mobile Touch Targets** 📱
- **Minimum height 44px** - All interactive elements
- **Improved spacing** - Better padding on mobile devices
- **Glass components** - Reduced padding on small screens (1.5rem → 1rem)
- **Flex alignment** - Proper inline-flex for clickable areas

### **9. Glassmorphism Improvements** ✨
- **Consistent blur effects** - `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)`
- **Light backgrounds** - White/light gradients instead of dark
- **Subtle borders** - `rgba(167, 210, 33, 0.15)`
- **Professional shadows** - Softer, more elegant shadows
- **Smooth transitions** - All glass elements animate on hover

### **10. Color System Standardization** 🎨

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to embed a Unicorn Studio animation on their homepage. They've provided:
1. Project ID: hofrlOLdrmuX0SYTFUfO
2. JS code snippet
3. A Framer component reference

Unicorn Studio is a 3D animation/interactive design tool that creates embeddable animations. Since this is an Astro project with React support, I should create a React component for this embed and add it to the homepage.

Let me:
1. Create a React component for the Unicorn Studio embed
2. Add it to the homepage (index.astro)
3. Make sure it's responsive and fits the design system

I'll create a clean React component that loads the Unicorn Studio script and initializes the project.</details></think>

---

Perfect! Let me help you embed your Unicorn Studio animation on the homepage. I'll create a clean React component for this and integrate it beautifully into your hero section.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now the Unicorn Studio animation is integrated. Let me create a summary for the user about what I've done.</details></think>

---

Perfect! ✨ I've successfully integrated your **Unicorn Studio 3D animation** into the homepage! Here's what I've implemented:

## 🎨 **What I Did:**

### 1️⃣ **Created UnicornStudioEmbed Component** (`src/components/UnicornStudioEmbed.jsx`)
- ✅ Clean React component with proper lifecycle management
- ✅ Loads the Unicorn Studio script dynamically
- ✅ Handles initialization and cleanup properly
- ✅ Configurable props (projectId, width, height)
- ✅ Performance optimizations:
  - DPI: 1.5 for quality/performance balance
  - FPS: 60 for smooth animation
  - Lazy loading enabled
  - Scale: 1 for optimal rendering

### 2️⃣ **Integrated into Homepage Hero Section**
- ✅ **Two-column layout** on desktop (Text left, Animation right)
- ✅ **Single column on mobile** for better UX
- ✅ Text alignment adapts (center on mobile, left on desktop)
- ✅ CTAs properly positioned

### 3️⃣ **Beautiful Styling**
```css
.unicorn-studio-container {
  - Glassmorphism effect with subtle green tint
  - Rounded corners (24px desktop, 16px tablet, 12px mobile)
  - Shadow with green glow
  - Responsive heights:
    • Desktop: 600px
    • Tablet: 500px
    • Mobile: 400px
    • Small mobile: 300px
}
```

### 4️⃣ **Accessibility Features**
- ✅ Proper ARIA labels
- ✅ Role="img" for screen readers
- ✅ Descriptive alt text

### 5️⃣ **Responsive Design**
- ✅ **Desktop (1024px+)**: Side-by-side layout with full 600px animation
- ✅ **Tablet (768px-1023px)**: Stacked layout with 500px animation
- ✅ **Mobile (480px-767px)**: Stacked with 400px animation
- ✅ **Small Mobile (<480px)**: Compact 300px animation

---

## 🚀 **How It Works:**

1. **Script Loading**: Component loads Unicorn Studio library only once
2. **Scene Initialization**: Your project (ID: `hofrlOLdrmuX0SYTFUfO`) gets initialized
3. **Cleanup**: Properly destroys scenes when component unmounts
4. **Error Handling**: Console logs if anything fails

---

## 📱 **What Users Will See:**

**Desktop:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Hero Text & CTAs  │  3D Animation (600px)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Mobile:**
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Hero Text & CTAs  │
├─────────────────────┤
│  3D Animation (400px)│
└─────────────────────┘
```

---

## 🎯 **Benefits:**

✅ **Professional Impact** - 3D animation adds modern, tech-forward feel  
✅ **Performance Optimized** - Lazy loading, proper FPS settings  
✅ **Mobile Friendly** - Adapts beautifully to all screen sizes  
✅ **Accessible** - Proper ARIA labels and semantic markup  
✅ **Clean Code** - Reusable component, easy to maintain  
✅ **Brand Consistent** - Glassmorphism with lime-green accents  

---

The animation will now load automatically on your homepage and create an **impressive, modern first impression** for your B2B clients! 🎉

Want to adjust the animation size, position, or add it to other pages? Just let me know!

Perfect! 🌙 I've successfully transformed your **entire Frog8 website into a sleek dark theme**! Here's everything I've done:

---

## 🎨 **Complete Dark Theme Transformation**

### **1. Global Color System** 🎨
**Updated CSS Variables:**
```css
--background: #0a0a0a         (Pure dark black)
--background-light: #121212   (Slightly lighter dark)
--background-card: #1a1a1a    (Card backgrounds)
--text: #f5f5f5              (Light text)
--text-muted: #a0a0a0        (Muted gray text)
--primary: #a7d221           (Your signature lime-green - UNCHANGED ✓)
```

**Body Background:**
- Dark gradient: `#0a0a0a → #0f0f0f → #121212`
- Fixed attachment for depth

---

### **2. Navigation Bar** 🧭
- **Dark glassmorphism**: `rgba(18, 18, 18, 0.95)`
- **Light text**: White/light gray links
- **Green accents on hover**: Links turn lime-green
- **Enhanced shadows**: Darker with green glow
- **Mobile hamburger**: Styled with green border and background

---

### **3. Mobile Menu Overlay** 📱
- **Dark background**: Matches nav styling
- **Light text**: White links with green hover
- **Close button**: Green themed with glow effect
- **Smooth animations**: Professional fade-in

---

### **4. Glassmorphism System** ✨
**All glass components now:**
```css
background: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.9)  /* Dark semi-transparent */
