Perfect! I've successfully added the Frog8 website demo link to the demo page. The new preview card has been added to the hero section alongside the existing Mumbai Metro console and Veriphy WhatsApp experience cards.

The new card features:
- **Title**: "Frog8 Corporate Website"
- **Description**: Showcases the complete brand story, solutions overview, and partner portal
- **Link**: Points to https://frog8-b2b-website-5878.bolt.host/
- **Chip**: "Live Website" (following the design pattern)

The change maintains the consistent glassmorphism styling and responsive design of the existing preview cards. No linter errors were introduced, so the demo page is ready to go!
