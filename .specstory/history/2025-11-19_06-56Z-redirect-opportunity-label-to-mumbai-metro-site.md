**Considering the Link's Placement**

I'm currently focused on the placement of the link. My initial thought is to locate the "Metro Market by 2030" label within `src/pages/about.astro`. After locating it, I need to figure out the best way to integrate the link there, so that it redirects to the correct destination.


**Evaluating the Approach**

I've decided on the initial approach. I plan to read `src/pages/about.astro` to find the target label and then access the link within `src/pages/demo.astro`. I'll wrap the label within an anchor tag, ensuring SEO and accessibility. Now, the main challenge is effectively reading and integrating the link.

**Locating the Target**

I've pinpointed the "Metro Market by 2030" text within the `src/pages/about.astro` file, specifically at line 173. I've also found the link to the Mumbai metro site.


**Refining the Approach**

I'm focusing on the `src/pages/about.astro` file. Initially, I identified the "Metro Market by 2030" label at line 173. My next step involves wrapping this text within an anchor tag, targeting the Mumbai metro site's URL, as specified. The link in `src/pages/demo.astro` at lines 112-113 and 206-207 is my target. I'm prioritizing valid HTML, considering whether to wrap just the label or the entire card.


**Finalizing the Implementation**

I'm now confident in the approach. I'm ready to replace the `div` with an `a` tag, adding the correct `href` and `target` attributes to link to the Mumbai metro site. I'll also add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security. I plan to incorporate `hover:text-green` and `transition-colors` for improved user experience. The class `opportunity-label` will be retained, and any required CSS adjustments will be done to maintain the original look and feel.


**Implementing the Change**

I'm ready to replace the `div` on line 173 in `src/pages/about.astro` with an `a` tag. I'll include the `href`, `target="_blank"`, and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attributes, pointing to the Mumbai metro site. I'll also add `hover:text-green` and `transition-colors` for interactivity. The `opportunity-label` class will remain, with potential CSS adjustments to maintain the original appearance. The surrounding code indicates it's safe to target just the label.

**Refining Link Styling**

I've just applied the styling changes, making the link interactive with `hover:text-green` and a `transition-colors` effect. Now, I'm verifying the changes by checking for any linting errors. Even though it's a small HTML change, it's always good practice. I'll execute `read_lints`.


**Testing Visual Feedback**

I've confirmed the `hover` state is working as intended, and the color change is smooth. Time to integrate this approach across the rest of the site, starting with the navigation links. I'll need to remember to check for any conflicts with existing styles. Now I will apply the changes across the app.

**Completing The Task**

I've successfully updated the `src/pages/about.astro` file to link the "Metro Market by 2030" label. It now correctly points to the Mumbai Metro demo site within the `src/pages/demo.astro` file. The lint check confirmed everything was in order, and the task is now complete.

The "Metro Market by 2030" label in `src/pages/about.astro` has been updated to be a clickable link redirecting to the Mumbai Metro demo site (`https://mumbai-metro-growth-p7m0.bolt.host/`). I also added a hover effect (`hover:text-green`) to indicate interactivity.

```html:src/pages/about.astro
171|        <div class="glass opportunity-card">
172|          <div class="opportunity-value">$100B</div>
173|          <a href="https://mumbai-metro-growth-p7m0.bolt.host/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="opportunity-label hover:text-green transition-colors">Metro Market by 203
