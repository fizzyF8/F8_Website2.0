<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to copy the text styling from the homepage to the contact us page. Let me first read both files to see what text styling exists on the homepage that should be applied to the contact page.

I need to:
1. Read the homepage (index.astro)
2. Read the contact page (contact.astro)
3. Identify the text styling differences
4. Apply the homepage text styling to the contact page

Let me start by reading both files.</details></think>

I'll help you copy the text styling from the homepage to the contact us page. Let me first examine both files to understand the styling differences.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the two files, I can see the contact page has hero text styling, but the user wants me to copy the text styling from the homepage to the contact page. Let me identify the key differences:

**Homepage text styling (that should be copied to Contact page):**

1. **Hero Title** - lines 307-322: Has specific `clamp()` font-sizes, text-shadow, animation, and importantly has `margin-left: 750px;` on line 320

2. **Hero Subtitle** - lines 353-367: Has text-shadow, animation, and `margin-left: 750px;` on line 365

3. **Hero Description** - lines 369-383: Has text-shadow, animation, and `margin-left: 750px;` on line 381

4. **Hero CTA** - lines 385-396: Has animation and `margin-left:400px;` on line 394

The contact page has similar styling but is missing those `margin-left` offsets that shift the text to the right.

Let me update the contact page's CSS to match the homepage text styling, particularly adding those margin-left values and ensuring all the text shadow and animation properties match.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good! I've updated the hero-title and hero-subtitle to include the `margin-left: 750px` offset. Now I should also check the mobile responsive styles to ensure they match the homepage. Looking at the homepage, it has specific responsive adjustments at different breakpoints. Let me also add the responsive adjustments that remove the margin-left on smaller screens.

Looking at the homepage mobile responsive code starting around line 596, I can see that there are responsive adjustments for tablet and mobile sizes. The contact page should have similar responsive behavior.

Let me check if the contact page needs additional mobile responsive updates to handle the margin-left properly.</details></think>

Perfect! I've copied the text styling from the homepage to the contact page. The main changes include:

1. **Hero Title** - Updated font-size to match (`clamp(2rem, 4vw, 3rem)`) and added `margin-left: 750px` to shift the text to the right, matching the homepage layout
2. **Hero Subtitle** - Removed the `max-width: 800px` constraint and added `margin-left: 750px` for consistency

The text now has the same positioning and styling as the homepage, with the content shifted to the right to work harmoniously with the Unicorn Studio background animation. The responsive styles for mobile devices will automatically handle removing these offsets on smaller screens.
