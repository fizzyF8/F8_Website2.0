# Use metro.webm as hero on kiosks page (2025-10-13 19:17Z)

_**User (2025-10-13 14:05Z)**_

use metro.webm in the kiosks page as the hero

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

I'll help you add the metro.webm video as the hero background for the kiosks page. Let me first examine the current kiosks page and then implement the video hero.


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/pages/kiosks.astro

---

Now I'll create a todo list to track the task and then implement the video hero for the kiosks page.


---

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [-] Add metro.webm video as hero background for kiosks page
- [ ] Style video hero with proper overlay and text positioning
- [ ] Ensure video hero works properly on mobile devices

---

Now I'll modify the kiosks page to add the metro.webm video as the hero background. I'll replace the current hero section with a video-based hero that maintains the same content but adds the video background.

The linter might be cached. Let me try a different approach - let me check how other video imports are handled in the codebase or use a different method. Let me check if there are any other video files being used:

Let me check how other assets are imported in the project to understand the correct pattern:

Tool use: **grep**

<details>

Perfect! I've successfully implemented the metro.webm video as the hero background for the kiosks page. Here's what I've accomplished:

## ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Added metro.webm video as hero background** - Replaced the static gradient background with a full-screen video hero
2. **Styled video hero with proper overlay** - Added a dark gradient overlay to ensure text readability
3. **Mobile optimization** - Implemented responsive design with different video heights and overlay opacity for mobile devices

## 🎬 Video Hero Features

- **Full-screen video background** using metro.webm
- **Auto-play, muted, looped** video for seamless experience
- **Dark gradient overlay** to ensure text readability over the video
- **Responsive design** that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Professional styling** that matches the Frog8 brand guidelines

## 📱 Mobile Optimizations

- Reduced video height on mobile (80vh on tablets, 70vh on phones)
- Increased overlay opacity on mobile for better text contrast
- Adjusted padding and spacing for mobile viewports

The video hero maintains the same content (title and description) as before but now has an engaging metro-themed video background that perfectly represents the transit automation solutions offered by Frog8. The video will automatically play when users visit the kiosks page, creating an immersive experience that showcases the metro environment where these kiosks are deployed.

_**User (2025-10-13 14:05Z)**_

I need it at the bottom right of the hero page, and not covering the whole page

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

I'll modify the video hero to position the metro.webm video at the bottom right corner instead of covering the whole page. Let me update the styling to create a smaller video element positioned in the bottom right.

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [-] Reposition metro.webm video to bottom right corner of hero
- [ ] Adjust video size to be smaller and not cover full page
- [ ] Update overlay and content positioning for new layout

Now let me update the todo list to mark the tasks as completed:


---

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [x] Reposition metro.webm video to bottom right corner of hero
- [x] Adjust video size to be smaller and not cover full page
- [x] Update overlay and content positioning for new layout

---

Perfect! I've successfully repositioned the metro.webm video to the bottom right corner of the hero section. Here's what I've implemented:

## ✅ Updated Video Hero Layout

### 🎬 Video Positioning
- **Bottom right corner** - Video is now positioned at `bottom: 2rem, right: 2rem`
- **Smaller size** - Video is now 300px × 200px (desktop) instead of full-screen
- **Rounded corners** - Added 16px border radius for a modern look
- **Glassmorphism styling** - Added subtle border and shadow effects matching the Frog8 design system

### 📱 Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: 300px × 200px video in bottom right
- **Tablet**: 250px × 160px video with adjusted positioning
- **Mobile**: 200px × 130px video with closer positioning to edges

### 🎨 Visual Enhancements
- **Background gradient** - Added a subtle dark gradient background to the hero section
- **Video styling** - Added Frog8 brand-colored border and shadow effects
- **Content positioning** - Text content remains centered and prominent
- **Z-index layering** - Proper layering ensures video doesn't interfere with content

The video now appears as a small, elegant element in the bottom right corner that adds visual interest without overwhelming the main content. It maintains the metro theme while keeping the focus on the "Unattended Automation" messaging and call-to-action.

## Todo List

- [x] Remove border from corner video
- [x] Increase video size for better visibility

---

Perfect! I've updated the video styling as requested:

## ✅ Updated Video Styling

### 🎬 Changes Made
- **Removed border** - Eliminated the `border: 2px solid rgba(167, 210, 33, 0.2)` property
- **Increased size** - Video is now larger for better visibility:
  - **Desktop**: 400px × 280px (increased from 300px × 200px)
  - **Tablet**: 320px × 220px (increased from 250px × 160px)  
  - **Mobile**: 260px × 180px (increased from 200px × 130px)

### 🎨 Visual Result
- **Cleaner look** - No border creates a more seamless appearance
- **Better visibility** - Larger size makes the metro video more prominent
- **Maintained styling** - Kept the rounded corners, shadow effects, and positioning
- **Responsive design** - All screen sizes updated proportionally

The video now appears larger and cleaner in the bottom right corner without the border, making it more prominent while maintaining the elegant positioning and styling that fits the Frog8 design system.

Perfect! I've successfully moved the metro.webm video to the top left corner of the hero section.

## ✅ Video Repositioned to Top Left

### 🎬 Changes Made
- **Desktop**: Video now positioned at `top: 2rem, left: 2rem` (600px × 450px)
- **Tablet**: Video positioned at `top: 1.5rem, left: 1.5rem` (320px × 220px)
- **Mobile**: Video positioned at `top: 1rem, left: 1rem` (260px × 180px)

### 🎨 Visual Result
- **Top left placement** - Video now appears in the upper left corner
- **Maintained size** - Kept your increased dimensions (600px × 450px on desktop)
- **Responsive design** - All screen sizes updated to use top-left positioning
- **Clean styling** - No border, rounded corners, and subtle shadow effects maintained

The video now appears prominently in the top left corner, creating a nice visual balance with the centered text content. This positioning gives the metro video more prominence while keeping the main "Unattended Automation" messaging clearly visible in the center of the hero section.
