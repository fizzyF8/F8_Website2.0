**Renaming titles of projects**

I've made progress on renaming the project titles on the about page. I've successfully changed "Transigo" to "Transit automation." Now, I'm analyzing "Navigo" to find a more suitable name that accurately reflects its function.


**Reading the about.astro page**

I've initiated the process of reading the `about.astro` page to pinpoint the "What We Build" section. After locating the section and its project descriptions, I'll be prepared to proceed with the renaming of Navigo and Veriphy.

**Investigating the Missing Section**

I've confirmed the "What We Build" section with the specified components doesn't exist in `about.astro`. Now, my focus shifts to the homepage, `src/pages/index.astro`, to see if the missing information might be located there. I'm checking to see if it's been inadvertently omitted or placed elsewhere.


**Exploring Potential Alternatives**

I've examined `about.astro` and confirmed the absence of the desired section. Proceeding with the specified investigation, I'm now cross-referencing against `src/pages/index.astro`. I suspect, however, that the section might be on a dedicated page such as `platforms.astro`, `deployments.astro`, or even, if it exists, `what-we-build.astro`. Those are next up for inspection.

**Analyzing the Index Page**

I'm currently focused on the `src/pages/index.astro` file, specifically the "What We Build" section. I've pinpointed its location within the code, between lines 205 and 249. My next step is to carefully examine the HTML structure within that segment, starting with the `what-we-build-grid` div.


**Reviewing HTML Structure**

I'm now diving deeper into the `what-we-build-grid` div within the index page. Specifically, I'm analyzing the structure of the `solution-card` elements, the layout of their headers, and the placement of the call-to-action buttons. My initial assessment suggests a consistent pattern for displaying the different solutions.


**Evaluating Content Updates**

I've reviewed the provided HTML and am now considering the requested content changes. The first update, renaming "Transigo" to "Transit Automation," appears straightforward. For "Navigo," I'm analyzing the context and descriptions. Given the mention of "Passbook Printing, CTS, Card Issuance," and after researching "Navigo" to look at its use cases, I am leaning toward "Self-Service Banking" as a more descriptive and user-friendly title, but I'll keep the other ones in mind. I need to ensure this change aligns with the underlying function of this card. Finally, for "Veriphy," I'm focused on understanding its function to propose a suitable title.


**Searching for Context on Navigo**

I've shifted my focus to the "Navigo" component within the `index.astro` file. To refine the title, I've initiated a search across the codebase, hoping to unearth more detailed information about its functionality. This search is ongoing, but I have not found additional information yet. Based on the description, I still believe that "Self-Service Banking" or "Retail Banking Kiosks" are the best options, assuming no new details appear.

**Inspecting Kiosk Content**

I've located the `src/pages/kiosks.astro` file, which appears relevant. Within it, I found a section titled "Navo Banking Automation Series," detailing functionalities like automated passbook printing and account updates. This is promising.


**Deciding on Renaming**

I'm now zeroing in on a suitable replacement title. Considering the user's need, I've analyzed the functionality: automated passbooks, cheque deposits, and card issuance, all falling under banking automation. Following the pattern set by other renamings, "Banking automation" feels like a strong contender, mirroring the existing "Banking Automation" subtitle and aligning well with the "Transit automation" model.


**Considering Title Alternatives**

I'm now weighing the best title for "Navigo." While "Banking Automation" fits, the user's focus on title changes raises a key point. "Banking automation" is similar to the original subtitle. I'm exploring alternatives that better represent the kiosk's nature. "Smart Banking Kiosks" and "Retail Banking Automation" have emerged as possibilities. I'm leaning toward "Banking Automation" because it strongly aligns with existing naming patterns. I'm also considering whether to address the subtitles.


**Formulating the Optimal Title**

I'm now back at the central question: determining the best title for "Navigo." The functions of Navigo—passbook printing, check deposit, and card issuance—all point to "Banking Automation," which feels like the natural fit. However, considering the user's focus, the subtitle's redundancy becomes a key factor. "Banking Automation" seems too close to the current subtitle. I'm now exploring options for how to address the existing subtitle. Should I update it, remove it, or leave it for later? I have to account for that.


**Evaluating Subtitle Updates**

I'm now contemplating how to handle the subtitle for "Navigo" after the title change. Since the existing subtitle is "Banking Automation," using that title would create redundancy. I'm exploring options like "Kiosks & Self-Service" or "Branch Transformation" to refresh the presentation, but for now, I am sticking to the title.


**Evaluating Subtitle Strategy**

I'm now determining how to handle the subtitle in conjunction with the title change. With "Banking automation" as the new title, the existing subtitle, "Banking Automation," would be redundant. Considering this, I am leaning toward updating the subtitle. Options I am considering are "Kiosks & Self-Service" or "Branch Transformation." I'm aiming for an improved presentation that avoids repetition and provides clearer context. However, based on the user's instructions, I will prioritize the title change, since it's most important.


**Refining Title and Subtitle**

I'm now focused on the final adjustments, specifically the interplay between the title and subtitle for "Navigo." Since "Banking Automation" will be the new title, the existing subtitle, also "Banking Automation," would be redundant. Therefore, I'm proposing to change the subtitle to "Self-Service Solutions" to better reflect the kiosk's functionality, or "Kiosks & Self-Service".


**Implementing the Title Change**

I'm now in the process of applying the title and subtitle updates.  Specifically, I plan to alter the `src/pages/index.astro` file. Within it, I intend to replace `<h3>Navigo</h3>` with `<h3>Banking automation</h3>`, and I'll adjust the corresponding subtitle from "Banking Automation" to "Self-Service Solutions" or "Kiosks & Self-Service" to avoid redundancy and improve clarity, and "Branch Transformation".


**Applying the Changes**

I'm now implementing the changes to the `src/pages/index.astro` file. I'll replace `<h3>Navigo</h3>` with `<h3>Banking automation</h3>`. Following the established pattern and to avoid redundancy, I will change the existing subtitle to "Self-Service Kiosks." This provides a clearer context. I'll also modify the other titles as specified. I'm focusing on consistency.


**Applying Final Adjustments**

I'm now in the process of finalizing the changes, aiming for consistency. I've decided to replace the `<h3>Navigo</h3>` with `<h3>Banking automation</h3>` in the `src/pages/index.astro` file. Alongside this, I'm replacing the existing subtitle, "Banking Automation," with "Self-Service Kiosks" to avoid any redundancy and improve the overall clarity and presentation of the banking automation offering. I'm aligning all updates with the pattern set by the other title changes.


**Executing Title Updates**

I'm now ready to perform the necessary edits to the `src/pages/index.astro` file. I'll replace `<h3>Navigo</h3>` with `<h3>Banking automation</h3>`. To address the redundancy, I'll update the subtitle, changing it from "Banking Automation" to "Self-Service Kiosks". I'll also modify the other titles as specified. I am aiming for consistency.

**Analyzing Website Changes**

I've been going through the changes in `src/pages/index.astro`, specifically the "What We Build" section.  I've replaced the titles to be more descriptive, like updating "Transigo" to "Transit automation" and "Navigo" to "Banking automation". I've also refined the subtitles, ensuring they accurately reflect the core functions.


**Revising Project Descriptions**

I've just finished the title updates in the "What We Build" section. "Veriphy" is now "WhatsApp workflow management." I also updated Navigo's subtitle, making sure we don't repeat functionality. Now I'll check for any linting errors that might have snuck in, even though it was a pretty straightforward text change.

**Verifying and Concluding**

I've confirmed the changes are implemented and functioning as intended. Now, I'm reviewing recently accessed files to ensure no other instances of "What We Build" slipped by. The user's feedback is the final piece of this puzzle, but I'm checking to be completely sure.


**Confirming and Checking**

I'm satisfied with the update's success! However, I'm doing a quick sweep of recent files; the "What We Build" reference was located in `index.astro`, and `src/pages/about.astro`, which I'd reviewed, looked clean. I'm finishing the cross-reference to confirm.


</details></think>

In the "What We Build" section of the homepage (`src/pages/index.astro`), I have updated the solution titles as requested:

1.  **Transigo** → **Transit automation**
2.  **Navigo** → **Banking automation** (I also updated its subtitle to "Self-Service Kiosks" to avoid redundancy with the new title)
3.  **Veriphy** → **WhatsApp workflow management**

I chose "Banking automation" for Navigo as it perfectly parallels "Transit automation" and accurately describes the functionality (Navo Passbook, Cheque, and Card issuance kiosks) as a suite of automated banking solutions.

**Analyzing Title Swaps**

I'm currently focused on the title and subtitle swap within the "What We Build" section.  The core task is straightforward: switch "WhatsApp workflow management" and "Messaging-Native Onboarding". I'm considering the potential impact on visual flow and whether any adjustments to the surrounding elements are warranted to maintain optimal readability and emphasis.


**Executing Code Modifications**

I've reviewed `src/pages/index.astro` and confirmed the target section. My focus now is on accurately implementing the title and subtitle swap within the specified HTML block. I'll need to carefully replace the existing text with the updated phrases, paying close attention to class names and any potential impacts on styling or layout. The change should be straightforward.


**Implementing Content Updates**

I've located the `veriphy` card in `src/pages/index.astro` and am ready to make the specified title and subtitle adjustments. My plan is to swap the text content within the `<h3>` and `<p class="solution-subtitle">` tags. This looks to be a direct replacement task, which shouldn't affect the existing styling.
