# Remove specific website sections (2025-10-09 19:23Z)

_**User (2025-10-09 16:55Z)**_

Remove Subscribe to Our Newsletter, Press & Media Inquiries, Schedule a Demo, Request a Callback

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to remove certain sections from the website. Let me first understand what they're asking for:
- "Subscribe to Our Newsletter"
- "Press & Media Inquiries"
- "Schedule a Demo"
- "Request a Callback"

These could be sections on various pages. Let me search for these in the codebase to see where they appear.

Since the user has the Navigation.astro file open, let me first check if any of these are navigation links. But these sound more like form sections or CTAs that might be on the contact page or other pages.

Let me search for these terms in the codebase.</details></think>

I'll search for these sections across the codebase to locate and remove them.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I found references to "Schedule a Demo" and "Request a Callback" in the contact.astro page. Let me read the contact.astro file to see the full context of these sections.</details></think>

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/pages/contact.astro

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the content. The user wants me to remove:
1. "Request a Callback" - appears in the Quick Actions section (lines 133-137)
2. "Schedule a Demo" - appears in the Quick Actions section (lines 138-142)
3. "Subscribe to Our Newsletter" - appears in the Newsletter section (lines 314-333)
4. "Press & Media Inquiries" - appears in the Newsletter section (lines 334-344)

I need to:
1. Remove the entire "Quick Actions" section (lines 126-150)
2. Remove the "Newsletter Signup & Media Contact" section (lines 310-347)
3. Remove the section dividers before them if they become orphaned

Let me make these edits.</details></think>

---

I'll remove those sections from the contact page. These are located in the Quick Actions section and the Newsletter section.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! I've successfully removed all four sections:
1. Request a Callback
2. Schedule a Demo
3. Subscribe to Our Newsletter
4. Press & Media Inquiries

I also removed the Quick Actions section entirely since the only thing left would have been "Download Brochure" and I removed the entire section as requested.

Let me check if there are any linting errors in the file.</details></think>
