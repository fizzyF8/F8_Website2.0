# Adjust hover icon brightness on homepage (2025-10-15 10:43Z)

_**User (2025-10-15 10:29Z)**_

on the homepage, in the thos section, the icons on hover become too bright/ light neon color which is making it hard on the eyes

I'll help you fix the overly bright hover effect on the icons in the "those" section of the homepage. Let me first examine the current homepage code to understand the issue.

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/pages/index.astro

Now I can see the issue! In the "Our Ethos" section (lines 62-115), the icons have a hover effect that changes their color to `#bdfc52` which is indeed a very bright, neon-like color. Looking at lines 532-535, when hovering over the ethos cards, the icons change from `#a7d221` (the brand primary color) to `#bdfc52` which is too bright and harsh on the eyes.

Let me fix this by making the hover color more subtle and easier on the eyes:

I also notice that the title color on hover also changes to the same bright color. Let me fix that as well:

Now let me check if there are any linting errors with my changes:

Perfect! I've successfully fixed the overly bright hover effect on the icons in the "Our Ethos" section of the homepage. Here's what I changed:

## Changes Made:

1. **Icon hover color**: Changed from `#bdfc52` (very bright neon green) to `#b8e32e` (a more subtle, lighter version of the brand green)
2. **Title hover color**: Also changed from `#bdfc52` to `#b8e32e` to maintain consistency

## Why This Fix Works:

- **`#b8e32e`** is still part of the brand color palette (it's the `--primary-light` color defined in your brand guidelines)
- It provides a subtle, pleasant hover effect without being harsh on the eyes
- It maintains the brand identity while being more accessible and comfortable to view
- The color transition is smooth and professional, fitting with the overall design aesthetic

The hover effect now uses a more balanced color that's easier on the eyes while still providing visual feedback when users interact with the ethos cards. The icons and titles will now have a gentler, more professional hover state that aligns better with the sophisticated design of your website.
